Hey! I'm Vex! Thanks for trying my antivirus!
If you would like to modify it, you can go into the directory where this text file is, go back to VSAV folder, then go to source, then open Vex's Simple Antivirus.
Click Source, Click Vex's Simple Antivirus, keep in mind you need Visual Studio to edit this project! Download it here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
Now that you got Visual Studio installed, download these required packages: .NET Desktop Development, and Desktop Development with C++.
Now go back to the file explorer window, right click "Vex's Simple Antivirus.sln", hover over "Open With", and click Visual Studio! Now you can freely edit the project!

This project is free to use, but if you could, please give me credit for the design, it's not required, but is just nice.

Again, thanks for trying my AV, Have fun!
